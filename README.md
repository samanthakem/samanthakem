### <em>Olá</em>, I am Samantha. 👋

Born and raised in Brazil (nordestina com orgulho), I currently live in California, USA and work as full-stack Software Engineer @Intuit. I love sharing knowledge so you might see me in tech conferences talking about JavaScript and Open Source. Last year, I presented at Grace Hopper Conference!
