### <em>Olá</em>, I am Samantha. 👋

Born and raised in Brazil, I currently live in USA and work as full-stack Software Engineer @Intuit. I am very passionate about teaching and because of that, I lead the Women of SDJS meetup where I teach topics related to JavaScript as well on how to contribute to Open Source.
